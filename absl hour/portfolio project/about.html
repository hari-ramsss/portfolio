            <div><h1>About Me/</h1></div>
            <p>I am a passionate, curious, and analytical second-year student with a deep love 
                for coding and problem-solving. Driven by a methodical approach, I tackle challenges step by step, always striving to expand my knowledge and refine my skills. Beyond my technical interests, I am also an artist at heart, with a natural inclination toward UI/UX design. My artistic background fuels not only my creativity but also my ability to empathize with users, ensuring that 
                every design resonates with their needs and expectations.
            </p>
            <h1 id="artist">-MY aRtisTic BackGroUnd-</h1>
            <span>I’ve been passionate about art and creativity from a very young age. What started with pencils and paper — exploring realism and expressive drawing — gradually evolved into a deeper journey of creativity. As I grew, I found a new canvas in the digital world. Coding became my modern-day brush, allowing me to translate my artistic vision into interactive and visually engaging experiences. Through this blend of art and technology, I continue to express my creative side, now in the form of design, interfaces, and digital innovation.</span>
